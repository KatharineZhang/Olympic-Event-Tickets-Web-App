TODO:

- make events.ts tests
- add mutation comment for getSPortEVents in routes.ts

IN PROGRESS:
- implement all server tests

DONE:
change map structure to include "event name + sport" as key!!!
- make Map<name, event> in routes.ts
- Back Click (load all the files again without saving)
    - this just re-renders the original fields so no need for this
- Refresh Click 
    - must GET infomration from the server:
        - sorted events by date
        - sorted events by ticket (Top 3)
        - sports list
        - all events
        - server side must have field names "sorted", "top3", "allSports", and "allEvents"
- Buy Tickets (updated map & all of the DS's, but would need to click Refresh in order for it to update the UI)
- Create Event Click (for Add Event page) (save in server, but would need to click refresh to refresh home page)
- Sport dropdown (send back list of events for sport)
- Get Tickets Click (for sport dropdown)
    - need to send back string[] sports list
